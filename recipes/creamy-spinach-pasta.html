    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fusilli pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 shallots, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>4 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Gorgonzola cheese</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fusilli in boiling water, occasionally stirring, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook shallots until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour in cream and cook until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Add spinach and crumble in Gorgonzola cheese. Season with salt and pepper and cook until spinach is wilted and sauce has thickened, about 4 minutes.</li>
